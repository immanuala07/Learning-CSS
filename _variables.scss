// ----- SASS Partials file -----
/*
Partials are separate SCSS files that contain chunks of CSS code,
typically for specific sections or components of your website.

Partials are named with an underscore (_) prefix in their filenames,
such as _variables.scss, _header.scss, etc.

This naming convention tells SCSS that these files are meant to be included
within other SCSS files and shouldn't be compiled into separate CSS files.
